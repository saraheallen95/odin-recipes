        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>12 ounces firm tofu</li>
            <li>Olive oil and salt</li>
            <li>2 sweet potatoes <em>(peeled/cubed)</em></li>
            <li>4 tablespoons green curry paste <em>(I used Thai Kitchen)</em></li>
            <li>three 14-ounces cans coconut milk</li>
            <li>about 3 cups broccoli florets</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Tofu: Press the tofu with paper towels to remove water. Cut tofu into cubes. In a large soup pot, heat the olive oil over medium high heat. Add the tofu, sprinkle with salt, and pan fry for 10-15 minutes, until golden brown. Remove and set aside.</li>
            <li>Veggies: Add sweet potatoes, coconut milk, and curry paste to the soup pot. Simmer for 5-10 minutes until potatoes are fork-tender. Add broccoli and tofu. Simmer for 3-5 minutes until broccoli is bright green.</li>
            <li>Finishing it off: I like to add a handful of golden raisins and cilantro (I know, I know, lots of levels of weird going on here) and I pinky promise that a quick swish of fish sauce and a sprinkle of brown sugar will take this over the top.    </li>
        </ol>
